RDF::Trine - An RDF Framework for Perl.

   RDF::Trine provides an RDF framework with an emphasis on extensibility, API
   stability, and the presence of a test suite. The package consists of several
   components:

   * RDF::Trine::Model - RDF model providing access to a triple store.
   * RDF::Trine::Parser - Native RDF parsers (RDF/XML, RDFa, Turtle, RDF/JSON,
     TriG, N-Triples, and N-Quads).
   * RDF::Trine::Serializer, a set of native RDF serializers for RDF/XML, Turtle,
     RDF/JSON, N-Triples, Canonical N-Triples, and N-Quads.
   * RDF::Trine::Store::DBI - A triple store for MySQL and SQLite, based on the
     Redland schema.
   * RDF::Trine::Iterator - Iterator classes for variable bindings and RDF
     statements, used by RDF::Trine::Store, RDF::Trine::Model, and RDF::Query.
   * RDF::Trine::Namespace - A convenience class for easily constructing RDF
     node objects from URI namespaces.
